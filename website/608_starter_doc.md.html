Dynamic Musical Interfaces
===============================================================================

In this project we are building a music studio using ESPs as various intruments and a central server to record the notes and create sound files. A typical user will be able to pick up an ESP equipped with sensors such as a distance reader and multiple buttons, and begin playing notes. The sounds will play in real time from the ESP as the user plays. At the same time, the ESP will be continuously sending this music data to a centralized server, along with an instrument id (guitar, theremin, etc). The central server will record this data on a database along with the timestamp. When a user opens the website, they will have an option to start and stop the recording. If the user starts, the server memorize the timestamp. When the user clicks "stop", the server will compile all the music notes that have been sent within that timeframe into a sound file, compress it, and server it to the website.
